				<p> <!--Text-->
					The internet has always been ever-changing. Very rarely do you see a cultural element on the internet that stays the same for a 
					significant amount of time. However, there are some events that change the internet landscape significantly. The most recent 
					event of note, and the most recent one I could remember, the the Black Lives Matter movement. After this event, there was a great 
					push for inclusivity from all places. For the genders, new genders were created accordingly to and were given recognition. For the 
					neurodivergent, tone indicators were introduced to help them understand text on the internet. Cancel culture judges all those who 
					disagree. This force reshaped and is currently reshaping the internet to be accessible for all. In these new conditions, some people 
					may find themselves in an unfamiliar environment as things changed. New users could be trying to get around having yet to learn how 
					to communicate properly with others on the internet. As a result, guides like these which are easily accessible on the internet 
					could be of utmost assistance when they are having trouble understanding what "I am living inside your walls" actually is for.
