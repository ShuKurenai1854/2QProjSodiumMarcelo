				<h3 class="sectionheader">What is BLM?</h3>
				<p>
					BLM stands for "Black Lives Matter".
					It was originally founded in 2013 by black community organizers Patrisse Khan-Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi.
					From the beginning, it has always been an online movement, being spread through the social media hashtag "#BlackLivesMatter".
					It was originally formed after the acquittal of George Zimmerman from his charges coming from his killing of Trayvon Martin.
					More notable movements of Black Lives Matter were their protests and demonstrations after the killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown.
					BLM gained more popularity on May 2020, after the death of George Floyd.
					Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes, despite George Floyd's protests that he couldn't breathe.
					This single event brought much attention to many wrong killings of black Americans, and affected many places, including the internet.
					It also caused many Americans to lose faith in their police force.

				<h3 class="sectionheader">How did BLM affect the internet?</h3>
				<p>
					Naturally, BLM had many effects on the internet.
					Many people would post messages of awareness towards the wrongful oppression of black people.
					The movement spread to a myriad of social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.
					This movement also shed light on many other groups that could be discriminated against, like the LGBT.
					Also around the time succeeding the event, many people started trying to be more understanding of others.
					As a result, many movements were made to spread awareness about disabled people, neurodivergent people, and people who once suffered from trauma.
					This may have also been the source of the trigger warning, or "TW".
