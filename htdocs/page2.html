				<h3 class="sectionheader">What is cancel culture?</h3>
				<p>
					Cancel culture is a phenomenon on the internet, primarily on Twitter, when people who share controversial opinions 
					are widely ostracized to the point where they can no longer retain their career and presence. It frequently begins 
					when a prominent person says or does an offensive action, and it usually results in the person being deprived of 
					their job and online influence. The term "cancel" began from the 1991 film <i>New Jack City</i>, which was referenced 
					by Lil Wayne in his song "I'm Single". Celebrities having their careers ended by cancel culture are actually very 
					few. Some of them continued to receive support even amidst their controversy as a result of public sympathy. Many 
					people also believe that cancel culture is excessive and is the result of mob mentality.

					Recently, cancel culture has become a popular topic in heated political debates. In America, while Democrats and 
					Democrat-leaning independents have heard of cancel culture just as much as Republicans and Republican-leaning 
					independents, conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats have heard of the term the most, with the liberal 
					Democrats hearing more. Adults between the ages of 18 and 29 have heard of it the most. Former President Donald 
					Trump has publicly spoken out against cancel culture, as well as other alleged censoring done by Facebook, Twitter, 
					and Google. According to Trump, "The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, 
					expelled, shamed, humiliated and driven from society as we know it."<a href="#cit4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>

					Many people have been canceled for certain undesirable actions.<a href="#cit3"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
				</div>
				<p>
					Cancel culture is a stark reminder for people to be more mindful of what they say and post online. One wrong or 
					misinterpreted message could be the end of one's popularity, presence, or even career. People behind cancel culture 
					believe that they are holding other people accountable for their actions. Cancel culture also serves as a way for 
					social media users with little to no power to voice out their opinions about people they find unpleasant. Of course, 
					there are a few people like Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, and Kevin Spacey who have faced permanent consequences from 
					cancel culture. Meanwhile, other celebrities would continue to retain their careers even after suffering backlash for 
					their controversy. Cancel culture has also raised opposition from media outlets and individuals who view it as 
					excessive. In conclusion, cancel culture has many opposing viewpoints concerning it, but what can't be changed is 
					the fact that many people have come together in support of it, and many other people have lost their livelihoods 
					over it.
