							<h3>About</h3>
							<p>
								This website is an informatory site dedicated to explaining and describing the newer trends of the internet and their effects on it.
								The internet is a wonderful place, but much has changed since the last time we may have known it, and sometimes people could use a little help.
								This site will discuss topics such as cancel culture, the LGBT community, and the newer subcultures of the internet.
								It will also provide help on some things you may find difficult such as new internet lingo, tone indicators, and more.
								We break down each topic in a way that could be understood by the general audience, so no one would be confused when they see something like "/j", or "chocosexual".
								This website could be used by parents when learning to communicate with their children, by teachers when trying to understand the new internet, or by scholars, for reference.

							<h3>Why</h3>
							<p>
								The internet is a contstantly-changing place, and some people my find it difficult to communicate in it thanks to these changes.
								We seek to make it simpler for normal people to be able to understand the internet, in order to clear any misunderstandings that may occur because of lack of knowledge on the subject matter, or on the language being used.
								It would be sad to see such misunderstandings break apart relationships, so we decided to make this website.
								We also want to help experts learn the ways of the internet, that they may study and analyze it for the greater good.
								Lastly, we seek to remove the stigma on old people and corporations placed by the internet on them for not having basic knowledge of it.
								People would call them "boomers" for not knowing how to use a meme properly.
